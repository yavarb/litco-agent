# LitKit Corpus Pull Skill

Census a custodian (or any filtered slice of the matter), pull every document's extracted text to disk with a self-citing header, and rank the texts for reading. This is the corpus-scale path for deposition packages and custodian reviews. It is not a substitute for reading: ranking decides the reading order, never what the record says.

## When to Use

- A witness's or custodian's whole file is needed (deposition package, custodian review, issue map).
- A question needs a complete set rather than examples ("every email between X and Y in 2021").
- Search keeps timing out or ranking, which means the question is a census question.

## Prerequisites

The `litkit` toolset on a matter host, used as the LitKit access rule below requires. The tools see exactly one matter, so there is no matter to pick. Every call acts for the lawyer on the current turn; a refusal (`permission_denied`) means that lawyer cannot see or do it, and the answer is to tell them, not to try another route.

## LitKit Access Rule

This rule governs every LitKit call in every skill.

1. The `litkit_*` tools are your access to LitKit. Each call carries the matter's credentials and the identity of the lawyer on the turn. Nothing else on the host gives you that access.
2. Never read credentials from the shell or from files. That includes any `LITCO_*` or `TYPESAFE_*` variable. Never call the LitKit API yourself with `curl`, a Python script, or any other command.
3. Never tell anyone that LitKit credentials are missing or unavailable. If any `litkit_*` call has worked in this session, your access works.
4. When a tool fails, report that tool's failure and quote its message, for example "`litkit_tags` bulk returned HTTP 500: …". Then say what you will do next: retry later, send a smaller request, or use another `litkit_*` tool that does the job. One tool's failure says nothing about the others.
5. A command held for approval did not run and did not fail. Infer nothing from it.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Tool | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Orient | `litkit_matter` | document count, custodians (exact spellings), productions, Bates prefixes |
| Source maps | `litkit_memos` action=list/read | prior review memos naming the best documents |
| Census | `litkit_docs` saveAs=<name>, custodian, dateFrom/dateTo | `census/<name>.jsonl` |
| Bulk text | `litkit_export_text` fromCensus=census/<name>.jsonl | `texts/<bates>.txt`, `texts/index.json` |
| Mentions | `litkit_search` on the person's name, then `litkit_export_text` dir=texts_x | `texts_x/` |
| Hot docs | `litkit_actions` action=hot_documents; `term_frequency` | LitKit's own rankings |
| One document | `litkit_text`, `litkit_pdf`, `litkit_document` | single text, PDF, metadata |

## Procedure

1. **Orient.** Run `litkit_matter`. Take the custodian spelling from its list, never from the request; requests arrive with phonetic misspellings and a custodian filter on the wrong spelling returns nothing. Read the prior review memos first (`litkit_memos` list, then read the relevant ones); they name Bates ranges worth pulling and save blind searching.
2. **Census.** `litkit_docs` with `saveAs` and the custodian (plus a date window if the request has one). The tool pages with LitKit's cursor until the set is complete and reports `rows`, `total`, and `complete`. If `complete` is false, rerun with the returned `resumeCursor` as `cursor`. Record the row count and the filters in `review/census_notes.md` so the total is reproducible. A 504 means the page budget ran out: add a date window and census in bands.
3. **Bulk text.** `litkit_export_text` with `fromCensus`. It batches 500 ids per call, writes each text as `texts/<bates>.txt` with a header (Bates range, docId, custodian, date, source route, retrieval time) above a line of sixty `=`, keeps `texts/index.json` keyed by docId, and skips documents already on disk, so a rerun resumes. Check the returned counts against the census: `written + skippedExisting + notFound` should equal the census rows. Documents reported `empty` have no text layer; read their PDFs (`litkit_pdf`) and look at the pages.
4. **Mentions and themes.** Documents that name the witness but sit in other custodians' files come from `litkit_search` on the name (quoted), exported to `texts_x/`; theory-term pulls go to `texts_theme/`. Separate folders keep provenance visible: custodian file versus mere mention.
5. **Rank.** Use `litkit_actions` `hot_documents` and `term_frequency` for LitKit's view, then score the texts on disk with a keyword table tied to the case theory (theory terms, project names, counterpart names) in `execute_code`. Read the top documents whole. Rank to order the reading; for a deposition package the issue map comes from reading the whole deduplicated custodian file, not from the scores.
6. **Bank passages as you read.** Append verbatim passages with their Bates cite and character offset to `review/source_bank_<n>.md`, copying programmatically from the text file. In-context copies do not survive compaction; files do.

## Pitfalls

- `litkit_search` is a mention-finder: 5 seconds, at most 500 hits, and common words fall to ranked matching. Zero hits or a timeout is not documentary absence. Use quoted phrases, distinctive names, or Bates numbers.
- The metadata date can be a collection or export date years after the content. Date a document from its internal timestamps and record the basis.
- Near-duplicates (a "[Copy]", a forward) often differ only in comments. Diff them on whitespace-normalized text; the annotated copy is the better exhibit when the witness's own comments appear only there.
- Dashboards and decks arrive as tab-delimited series; embedded charts do not survive extraction. Quote a number only where its label and value both appear in the text; otherwise fetch the PDF.
- Text over 200,000 characters is truncated by LitKit; the header says so. Read the PDF for the rest.
- A refusal is an answer. If the lawyer on the turn lacks access to a document or an action, say so plainly and name who can grant it.

## Verification

- Census rows, exported texts, not-found, and empty counts reconcile and are stated as numbers.
- Every text file opens with its Bates header; spot-check five against `litkit_document`.
- Any passage later quoted is copied from `texts/` and carries the Bates cite from the header.
